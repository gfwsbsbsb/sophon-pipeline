# yolov5

## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 Definition

- Run YOLO object detection using pipeline.
- When running N video streams with FPS of M, the FPS of detector `det` reaches `N * M / (1 + [skip])` or the average single-way speed reaches `M / (1 + [skip])`, where `[skip]` is the number of frame skips for interframe detection. This means that the current environment can satisfy the processing of N video streams with FPS of M with `[skip]` frames.

## 2 compilation

Please refer to [sophon-pipeline compile instructions](../../README_en.md#23-Compile instructions)

## 3 Operation

### 3.1 Configuration file

Please note to modify the`${SOPHON_PIPELINE}/release/yolov5s_demo/cameras_yolov5.json`configuration file before runningï¼š

```bash
{
  "cards": [													# If you need to configure multiple devices, you can add multiple groups of 'devid' and 'cameras' information under 'cards'
    {
      "devid": 0,												# device id
      "cameras": [												# If you need to configure multiple video streams, you can add multiple sets of [address] and [chan_num] information in [cameras]. If multiple [addresses] or multiple [cards] are configured, the total number of video streams is the sum of all [chan_num] numbers
        {
          "address": "./elevator-1080p-25fps-4000kbps.h264",	# Address of the video stream to be tested, if it is a local file, only h264/h265 formats are supported
          "chan_num": 1,										# Configure the number of [chan_num] channels for the video stream with the content of [address] above. The default setting is 1, which will access 1 video stream with the above [address] content.
          "model_names": ["ex1"]								# The model name for testing this [address] video stream needs to be the same as the model custom name [name] within the [models] parameter below this configuration file, indicating the use of this model, with multiple model names separated by commas.
        }
      ]
    }ï¼Œ
  ],
  
  "pipeline": {													# Number of threads and queue length in pipeline
    "preprocess": {
      "thread_num": 4,											# Number of pre-processing threads
      "queue_size": 16											# Maximum length of pre-processing queue
    },
    "inference": {
      "thread_num": 1,											# Number of inference threads
      "queue_size": 16											# Maximum length of inference queue
    },
    "postprocess": {
      "thread_num": 4,											# Number of post-processing threads
      "queue_size": 16											# Maximum length of post-processing queue
    }
  },
  "models":[
    {
      "name": "ex1",											# Custom name of the model corresponding to [path]
      "path": "your_bmodel_path.bmodel",	        			# The path to the bmodel model corresponding to [name]. The model must be the same as the command line parameter [model_pose] to configure the model.
      "model_type": "yolov5s",									# Model type of the bmodel. It is necessary to choose the corresponding model_type according to the bmodel, otherwise the accuracy may be affected. Support yolov5, yolov6, yolov7, yolov8. This example provides: yolov5s, yolov6s yolov7, yolov8s. The default is yolov5s.
      "skip_frame_num": 0,										# The number of frames to be skipped for inter-frame detection. When set to 0, the program does not skip frames, when set to 1, the program does a model pipeline every 1 frames.
      "output_path": "output_path",                     		#Output address, only support rtsp, tcp format is protocol://ip:port/, for example rtsp://192.168.0.1:8554/test, tcp://172.28.1.1:5353. for rtsp push stream, the address is the address configured by rtsp server. For tcp, you need to open the port you configured.
      
      "obj_threshold": 0.5,										# Confidence threshold for the bmodel post-processing, corresponding to [path]
      "nms_threshold": 0.5										# nms threshold for the bmodel post-processing, corresponding to [path]
      "class_threshold": 0.5,									# class threshold for the bmodel post-processing, correspinding to [path]
      
    }
  ]
}
```

> **NOTE**  
> 
> The number of threads and queue length can be defined by the device itself. In principle, the number of pre-processing threads and post-processing threads is set to the number of logical CPUs of the device. The number of inference threads for a single pipeline is typically 1.

> ðŸš€ tagged models are supported on BM1684X(x86 PCIe, arm SoC). If you would like to use  ðŸš€ tagged models, modify ${SOPHON-PIPELINE}/CMakeLists.txt on Line 11, set USE_TPU_KERNEL to ON, then recompile the program, and download the libbm1684x_kernel_module.so for supporting use. To obtain ðŸš€ tagged models, please refer to [sophon-demo/sample/YOLOv5_opt](https://github.com/sophgo/sophon-demo/tree/release/sample/YOLOv5_opt).
